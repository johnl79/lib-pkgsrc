The MonetDB database is developed by the CWI database research group
(see http://www.monetdb.org/).

Via the MonetDB project we have brought the MonetDB system in open source,
where it is accessible at http://www.monetdb.org/Downloads/

The MonetDB database system is a high-performance database kernel for
query-intensive applications. The MonetDB kernel works together with an
SQL frontend that is in a separate CVS module.
